DIO

1.  The DIO Driver shall provide a service that writes a data word to the assigned DIO port
2.  The DIO Driver shall provide a service that writes a selectable number of adjoining bits to an assigned part of a DIO port
3.  The DIO Driver shall provide a service for write access to single DIO channels
4.  The DIO Driver shall provide a service for reading a data word from the assigned DIO port
5.  The DIO Driver shall provide a service for reading a selectable number of adjoining bits from an assigned part of a DIO port
6.  The DIO Driver shall provide a service for reading one bit of an assigned DIO channel
7.  The DIO Driver shall provide a service to flip
8.  The DIO driver shall allow reading from and writing to DIO ports, channel groups and channels

9.  Provide atomicity of DIO access

PORT

1.The Port driver shall allow the static configuration of the following options for each port
                  Mandatory parameters:
 			 pin usage (e.g. DIO, ADC, SPI, ...)
			 pin direction (input, output)
			 pin level init value
			 pin direction changeable during runtime (yes/no)
		Optional parameters (only if supported by hardware):
			 activation of internal pull-ups/pull-downs
			 slew rate control
			 input thresholds
			 pin driver mode (push-pull/open drain)
			 further microcontroller specific properties 
2. The port driver shall allow the static configuration of the port pin names
3. The Port driver shall provide a service for setting the direction of port pins during runtime
4.  The Port driver shall provide a service to refresh the direction of all configured ports

6.  All re-entrant functions of the Port Driver shall perform port register access actions in an atomic way
7.  Ports and port pins that are not used shall be set to a defined state
